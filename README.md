# Simple Keylogger
Keyloggers or keystroke loggers are software programs or hardware devices that track the activities (keys pressed) of a keyboard. Keyloggers are commonly used for legitimate purposes, such as monitoring employee activity, parental control, or forensic investigation. However, they can also be deployed maliciously by attackers to capture sensitive information, such as passwords, credit card numbers, and personal messages, without the user's knowledge or consent.
## Features

- Capture all keystrokes.
- Log the recorded keystrokes to a file(keylog.txt).
- Stop logging when the `esc` key is pressed.
- Ensure ethical considerations and permissions are in place.
